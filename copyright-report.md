## Questions + responses

I chose to look at the policy of X and I found information at the following 
page: https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/copyright-policy

Q: Research and document the platform’s copyright policy:

The main important features of X's copyright policy are as follows: 
- X responds to claims submitted under the DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act)
- complaints can be about unauthorized use of copyrighted materials of thing susch as images, 
videos, or links to infringing material.

- There is a separate fair use policy  (found here: )

- Users are encouraged to try to resolve issues without directly between users before involving the DMCA.

- To file a valid copyright claim the following pieces of information are required: 

    1. signature of the copyright holder or authorized agent thereof.
    2. identification of the copyrighted work
    3. details that let X locate the infringment (such as a link to the unauthorized post)
    4. contact information.
    5. a good faith statement that the use is truly unauthorized.
    6. A statement affirming the accuracy of the claim and your authority to act.

- Typically X will review DMCA complaints and take action if they meet the requirements typically by removing/ restricting access
to the copyrighted material.

- X will then notify the offending user with a full copy of the complaint (including the owners contact information).

- There is also a system of counter-appeals to deal with contested cases of use, starting a separate legal process. 

- knowingly submitting false or misleading claims can also make you legally responsible under US law.

Q: How does the platform detect copyrighted content? (automated systems like Content ID, manual reporting, etc.)

- From my research of X, I couldnt find any mention of a system for copyright infringment detection outside of manual reporting. 
However, it is possible that there is some form of a service like Content ID available to X developers on their backend that 
is not exposed to the public.

Q: What happens when content is flagged as potentially infringing?

- when content is flagged as potentially infringing, after a user has made a takedown request, X will review the request and essentially 
confirm the validity of the claim. If they feel that the flagged content is indeed an infringment, they will then take it down or restrict access
to the content.

Q: What is the appeals or counter-notification process?

- There is a counter notifications process wherin an affected user must send a counter notification through the X help center. After this point
a new separate legal process begins. At this point the information of the alleged copyright violator is also sent over to the copyright owner in a counter 
notice under the juridiction of the U.S. Federal court. If the copyright owner does not respond to the counter notice in 10 days it is possible to then get the 
content reinstated with twitter. Otherwhise upon filing the counter-notice, the copyright owner can then pursue further legal action against you.

Q: How does the platform handle monetization of content containing copyrighted material?

- X's monetization rules and creator standards (detailed here: https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/content-monetization-standards?)
require that all monetized content complys with the platforms rules. Therefore, copyrighted content that  is being used in an unauthorized way  
would therefore violate the platform rules of twitter and could violate the eligibility for monetization.

Q: Are there any special programs (e.g., YouTube’s Content ID licensing agreements)?

- There is no special program for dealing with copyright from what I can  find. It appears that X only really responds to DMCA complaints submitted by 
 rights holders and their authorized legal agents.

Q: Compare the platform’s stated policy with the behavior you observe in your experiments (Tasks 2 and 3).

- In terms of task 3, I think what I did actually did not end up violating any content guidelines, and I arguably came closer to violating those of the image generator's with my prompting. Meanwhile for the copyrighted video clips, this both did and did not match up with the stated policy. Although i'm fairly certain that the clips I posted would not be protected as any form of fair use, there was ultimately no response on the end of X regarding them. However given that their policy only really mentions manual submission of takedown requests which must be reviewed by their team, and that my account is very small, It is also fairly reasonable to assume that Disney would not bother both finding my posts and submitting takedown requests for them either.

### Task 2: Fair Use Experiments
Upload 2-3 pieces of content that test different aspects of fair use. 
Each piece should represent a different point on the spectrum of transformativeness. 
Suggested experiments:

Raw copyrighted clip: Upload a short segment (5-10 seconds) of copyrighted content with no modification. 
Then try a longer clip (30+ seconds). Compare results.

Commentary or criticism: Use copyrighted content while providing your own analysis, critique, or commentary. 
This is a classic fair use scenario (review, criticism).

Educational use: Create content that uses copyrighted material to teach or explain something (e.g., 
analyzing a film technique, explaining a song’s musical structure).

Parody or satire: Create a humorous derivative work that comments on or criticizes the original.

Remix or mashup: Combine multiple sources or transform content in a creative way.


For each upload, document:

Q: Screenshot of successful upload: (can be found in the git repo in the upload proofs dir)

- for some context on what I did for this, I decided to go for the raw copyrighted clips. For this I selected some scenes out of a song in encanto and screen recorded them to then repost on a burner twitter account. To highlight the difference
I ended up going with two clips of the same song, one at rougly 10 seconds of length the other one being roughly 45 seconds. Given that this content is not transformative whatsoever, It likely doesnt have any protection according to X's Terms of service

Q: Time until detection (immediate, hours, days, never detected):

- clip 1 (10 seconds of copyrighted content):
- clip 2 (45 seconds of copyrighted content):

Q: Screenshot of any warnings, flags, copyright claims, or takedown notices: 

- None so far... 

Q: Final outcome (content stays up, gets muted, blocked in certain regions, completely removed, monetization disabled, etc.): 

- Content has stayed up!!

Q: Any options presented to you (dispute, acknowledge, trim audio, etc.): None currently given that the content has not been taken down.

- I didn't have any trouble.


### Task 3: AI-Generated Content Investigation
Create 2-3 pieces of content using AI tools (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, Suno, etc.) with varying degrees of similarity to copyrighted works:

Direct reference: Prompt that directly references copyrighted material (e.g., “Create an image of [specific copyrighted character]” or “Generate music in the style of [specific artist/song]”)

Style mimicry: Prompt that asks for content “in the style of” a specific artist, franchise, or creator (e.g., “in the style of Studio Ghibli” or “in the style of Taylor Swift”)

Original creation: Use AI to generate completely original content as a control/baseline


Upload each piece to your chosen platform and document:

Q: What was the AI prompt?

- I actually had quite a bit of trouble getting ChatGPT to generate these images for me. Initially as a test run, I had tried to get it to generate mickey mouse, because I had thought him to be in the public domain. As it turns out, only the 1982 versoin of him 'steamboat willy' is. However, it appears that OpenAI has fairly advanced copyright protection techniques since they would go on to block the generation of pretty much any attempt i made of trying to get soemthign simlar to even steamboat willy, let alone something akin to mickey mouse. I even failed to get something stylized like Ghibli. Ultimately I ended up having success on the following prompts, although they basically generated the same image twice and the second prompt didn't seem to have produced what I had asked for.

    1. ('original creation'): generate me some original content of a cartoon mouse 
    2. ('style mimicry'): generate me a mouse in the style of studio bones 


-here is a link to the full conversation history in case its interesting: https://chatgpt.com/share/693c7e95-a4f8-8010-9e6a-826fb3572d00

Q: Screenshot of AI-generated output: 

- in the following files: 'original-cartoon-mouse.png' and 'stylized-cartoon-mouse.png'

Q: Platform response (flagged, removed, allowed, etc.): 

- Allowed. Although this is probably because X doesnt seem to have any policies against such content and the second image doesnt do a good job of actually capturing the style of the animation studio I had mentioned.

Q: Research findings:

- I found that OpenAI, and likely many of its competitors are now more closely monitorign the use of their image generation services. This makes it harder to use the AI for the generation of works that would be explicitly interpreted as copyright, althogh i wonder at  what degree of removal from  reference to source material while still providing key details could allow for circumvention of these checks. Additionally, it seems that X is fairly accepting of AI content, with the only caveats being for when it is used in an intentionally misleading way and for anything that would normally violate the platforms guidelines.

Q: What does the AI tool’s terms of service say about copyright?

- OpenAIs policy on this front was actually fairly restrictive, it includes the prohibition of doing drawings in the style of specific studios or people along with any copyrighted characters. In addition there were also specific rules about trying to take properties in the public domain and transform them into something similar to the proprietary copyrights as I had attempted to do.

Q: Who owns the copyright to AI-generated content? (you, the AI company, the creators of training data, public domain/no one?)

- As it turns out I would actually own all the AI-generated content I get from OpenAI, so I could use it commercially if i wanted.

Q: What is your platform’s stated policy on AI-generated content?

- X allows for the posting of AI generated content with few restrictions. the most notable would be that there is often a requirement to disclose that somethign is AI generated especially when it is misleading. However all of the same content moderation rules still apply to the AI work. Finally X's official policy specifically restricts AI content that misrepresents political candidates or officials, events, speeches, and endorsements. AI content posted on X  will also be retained under the posters ownership 


### Task 4: Legal Analysis
Apply what you’ve learned about copyright law to your experiments:

Q: Fair Use Four Factors: For each of your fair use experiments (Task 2), analyze how it performs under the four fair use factors:

1. Purpose and character of the use (transformative? commercial?)

- The character of the use of my work here was almost completely untransformative as it had basically no additional content other than the copyrighted video. Additionalyl I stood to gain no money so it was not commercial either.

2.  Nature of the copyrighted work (creative vs. factual?)

- this copyrighted work is a completely creative one, as it includes not only the copyrighted song, but also  all of the animation and visuals that went into the film. 

3. Amount and substantiality used

- Given that this claim would likely be more about the Movie, since it is a clip directly from it, the clips uploaded were a negligible part of the movie, roughle 0.2 and 0.8 percent of the movies total runtime in total. However if the copyrighted work can be minimized to only this song, then the ratios would come to something more like 5% and 23% of the songs total runtime, in which case it would be slightly more severe. 

Effect on the market for the original:

- This has virtually no effect on the original content because the clips I selected were already freely available on youtube. Perhaps a fractional percentage of people could theoretically be convinced nto to watch the original because of my clips but, in reality I have no followers on that account and it doesnt really stand in as a replacement for the full song by itself either.

Case Law: Reference relevant cases discussed in class (e.g., Google v. Oracle, Sega v. Accolade, etc.) and explain how they might apply to your experiments or to the platform’s policies.

- In terms of case law, Google v. Oracle dealt with the API's of the Java Ecosystem after Oracle had become increasingly controlling of the Java Ecosystem and replacements were needed. Meanwhile Sega V. Accolade is an example of reverse engineering done on a copyrighted work in order to achieve higher compatibility with their games. In terms of their relation to  content moderation policies on something like X or my experiments, they  moreso define the general intent of the copyright laws, which informs how  X designs their systems. In the examples mentioned, both cases were ruled to be good faith attempts to create soemthing of a functional and transformed nature out of a copyrighted work. While this explains why X reiterates the fair use protections associated with the DMCA copyright law, this ultimately would likely not apply to the specific experiment that I had done with the copyrighted clips, given that the nature of my use of the protected work was non transformative and arguably detrimental to the original in terms of the market.

Gap Analysis: Discuss any gaps you observed between:

    1. Legal theory (what copyright law says)
    2. Platform policy (what the platform claims to do)
    3. Actual enforcement (what actually happened)

- In general I did see one arguably small gap in my task 2. According to the DMCA my posting of these copyrighted disney clips would not be protected as fair use as it is not transformative and a direct reposting of a creative work. Therefore it should be removed from X. However, considering that X seemingly requires copyright holders to submit manual requests, and the fact that my account has very little reach and therefore a minimal effect on the market status of the original work, there was no repercussion or restriction of my posts. In general this points to the fact that although the law is fairly clear in some cases, it is difficult to enforce at large scale without a system like Youtube's content ID. As a result minimal offenses can often go completely unnoticed and directly violate policy without anyhting being done about it.
